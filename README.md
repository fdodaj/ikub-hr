# Registration management

The program should manage the registrations of those interested in the academy courses. 
It consists in creating three interfaces.
  - add course
  - new entry
  - search and modification of registration data

The main interface will serve to add a new course for which registrations are open.

The second interface will serve to set the personal data of students who are interested in taking part in a course

The third interface will create the possibility of searching and modifying the registration data.
